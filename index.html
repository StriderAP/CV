                <h3>Development and Design</h3>
                <p class="skill-desc1">
                    The senior year courses for my Computer Information Systems degree required an emphasis on Web Application Development and Administration.  I
                    received a solid foundation in HTML, Cascading Style Sheets and ASP.NET 3.5 with C# as the primary language.  Since graduating, I have added
                    ASP.NET versions 3.5 through 4.6 (C#) and 4.7.2 (Visual Basic), JavaScript, Java, jQuery, SQL (Microsoft SQL, MySQL, PostGreSQL), along with
                    other stacks, languages, frameworks and technologies to my developer toolkit.  I would like to put my knowledge to work for you!

                    Whether you need older code updated, or you would like to refactor your code to make it more scaleable and reuseable, I can help you.  
                    Maybe you have wanted to start your own blog, but don't know where to start.  I can help you with that, too.  Check out some of my other work by

            <p>
                It doesn't matter if you have a small web development and design project.  Maybe you need to add another team member for your enterprise web development 
                and design team.  It could be all you want is a quick sanity check in a consultuing session.  You will want to contact me if any of these describe your 
                current web design and development dilemma.  Cheers!
