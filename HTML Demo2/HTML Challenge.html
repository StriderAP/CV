		Earth is the third planet orbiting the star we refer to as the sun.  The sun is found in the outer part of one of the arms of the Milky Way
		galaxy.<sup>1</sup>  According to <a href="https://space-facts.com/earth/">Space Facts</a>, Earth is the largest of the four terrestrial planets
		in the solar system.  The four terrestrial planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.<sup>2</sup>  It is also interesting to note that Earth is
		the only planet in our solar system not named for a Greek or Roman deity.<sup>2</sup>  The Earth is believed to have been formed approximately 4.54
		billion years ago<sup>2</sup> (though a Hostess Twinkie from around that era has yet to be found to confirm this).  The Earth is the only planet
		in our solar system known to support life.<sup>2</sup>

		<li>Distance Around Equator:  40,074 km (24,901 miles)</li>
